*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. Amazingly, there are no named female characters in the story. So this "tweak", created by a modern librarian (and sometime web developer), is named for [the most famous *modern librarian*](http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_m/music_man.htm)

This repo was created with [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), and some elements of [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). Thanks to everyone who contributed directly or indirectly to either of those projects.

The final sidebar configuration was inspired by [Jelena Jovanovic's codepen demo](https://codepen.io/plavookac/full/qomrMw).

The parallax background effect was adapted from the [codepen demo](https://codepen.io/karldanninger/pen/NwzMzN) created by [Karl Danninger](https://www.okgrow.com/posts/css-only-parallax).
