title: Mudie Who?
---

*The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde* tells the story of a lawyer investigating the connection of two persons, Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde. The author wanted to name this project after a female character from the book, but there are no named female characters in the story. So this "tweak", created by a  librarian (and sometime web developer), is named for [the Victorian-era proprietor of circulating libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Edward_Mudie) who would have provided access to Stevenson's novels for much of the non-wealthy populace of 1880s Britain.

The final sidebar configuration was inspired by [Jelena Jovanovic's codepen demo](https://codepen.io/plavookac/full/qomrMw).

The parallax background effect was adapted from the [codepen demo](https://codepen.io/karldanninger/pen/NwzMzN) created by [Karl Danninger](https://www.okgrow.com/posts/css-only-parallax).
