This repo was created with [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), then modified by adding some elements of [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). The purpose for this process was to take advantage of the current (as of March 2019) scss files/structure from Poole. Thanks to everyone who contributed directly or indirectly to either of those projects.

The final sidebar configuration was inspired by [Jelena Jovanovic's codepen demo](https://codepen.io/plavookac/full/qomrMw).

The parallax background effect was adapted from the [codepen demo](https://codepen.io/karldanninger/pen/NwzMzN) created by [Karl Danninger](https://www.okgrow.com/posts/css-only-parallax).
