# WestPac Announcements

**WestPac** is the Western Pacific Chapter of the American Association of Law Libraries (AALL); serving libraries and law librarians in Alaska, Hawai'i, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming, as well as British Columbia (Canada).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This "blog" is the source for the announcements on the [WestPac website](http://chapters.aallnet.org/westpac/), the chapter's home page.

**PLEASE NOTE:** \<username\>.github.io pages are required to use the "Master" branch for site generation. If for some unimaginable reason anyone ever wants to fork this repo, the "clean" branch is **gh-pages**. Backwards, we know. Sorry.

Announcements on this site are contributed by librarian volunteers who don't necessarily code, so we are using the [Gabriel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gabriel/okimajjeocnndpifeelaajdebkkbckff?hl=en-GB) add-on for Google Docs to make the process easier. Posts submitted via an authorized Gabriel instance are automatically posted without any moderation.

This repo was created with [Poole](http://getpoole.com/), then modified by adding some elements of [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). We wanted to take advantage of the current (as of March 2019) scss files/structure from Poole. Thanks to everyone who contributed directly or indirectly to either of those projects.

The final sidebar configuration was inspired by [Jelena Jovanovic's codepen demo](https://codepen.io/plavookac/full/qomrMw).

The parallax background effect was adapted from the [codepen demo](https://codepen.io/karldanninger/pen/NwzMzN) created by [Karl Danninger](https://www.okgrow.com/posts/css-only-parallax).
